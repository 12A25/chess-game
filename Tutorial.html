<h1>Using the Board Editor</h1>
<p>This website mimics a physical chess board. As such, it is simple and intuitive to use.
 There are two parts: the board itself, and the replacement table.</p>
<h2>Chessboard</h2>
<p>The chessboard is the grid of 64 red and white squares with pieces in the middle of the 
screen. To select a piece, click on its square. To move it, simply click on another 
square on the board. The piece will be moved to that square. If there is another piece
 on the square, that piece will be replaced.</p>
<h2>Replacement Table</h2>
<p>The replacement table is located beneath the chess board. Like on the board, click on
 a piece to select it. When you click on a square on the board, the piece will be replicated
  there (unlike on the chessboard, the original piece on the replacement table is 
   not removed. To remove pieces from the chessboard, first click on the red X on 
   the replacement table, then click on the piece.</p>
   <h1> HOW TO PLAY CHESS(RULES)</h1>
   The goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is under attack (in "check") and cannot escape capture.

   Game Setup
   The board is 8x8, with each player controlling 16 pieces:
   
   1 King
   1 Queen
   2 Rooks
   2 Bishops
   2 Knights
   8 Pawns
   Piece Movements
   
   Pawn
   
   Moves forward one square; two squares on its first move.
   Captures diagonally one square.
   Special Moves:
   En passant: Capture a pawn that has moved two squares forward on its first move, as if it had moved one square.
   Promotion: Upon reaching the opponentâ€™s back rank, a pawn can be promoted to any piece (except a king).
   Rook
   
   Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
   Bishop
   
   Moves any number of squares diagonally.
   Knight
   
   Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular.
   The only piece that can jump over others.
   Queen
   
   Combines the moves of a rook and bishop: moves any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
   King
   
   Moves one square in any direction.
   Special Move:
   Castling: Moves two squares toward a rook, and the rook jumps over the king. Conditions: no pieces between them, neither has moved, and the king is not in check.
   Game Endings
   
   Checkmate: The king is in check and cannot escape.
   Stalemate: The player has no legal moves, and the king is not in check (draw).
   Draw: By agreement, repetition, insufficient material, or 50-move rule.
   Resignation: A player concedes.
